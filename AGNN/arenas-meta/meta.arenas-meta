long-description: This is the metabolic network of the roundworm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.  Nodes are metabolites (e.g., proteins), and edges are interactions between them.  Since a metabolite can iteract with itself, the network contains loops.  The interactions are undirected.  There may be multiple interactions between any two metabolites.
